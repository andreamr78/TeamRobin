### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your system
- MongoDB instance running (local or cloud-based, e.g., MongoDB Atlas)

### Steps
To run both frontend and backend servers concurrently, you can use **concurrently**. Install it globally or add it to your project dependencies:
```sh
npm install -g concurrently
```
Or install it as a dev dependency:
```sh
npm install concurrently --save-dev
```
Then, modify the scripts section in your `package.json` to include:
```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "concurrently \"cd backend && npm start\" \"cd frontend && npm start\""
}
```
You can then start both servers with:
```sh
npm start
```
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/andreamr78/TeamRobin.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd TeamRobin
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the backend server:
   ```sh
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```
5. Start the frontend:
   ```sh
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```
